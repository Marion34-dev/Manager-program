# Manager program

## About the program
This is a python program that reads from the tasks.txt and user.txt files. It has a login section and helps a company keep track of the (overdue) tasks. It enables the user to view all tasks, view all the tasks only assigned to the user who is logged in, enter a new task, enter a new user (only admin), mark the task as complete, generate reports and display statistics (only admin). <br>
It involves the use of user-defined functions, dictionaries, lists and handling txt files.

## Usage section 
You can navigate through the menu and select the option you would like to try. The while loop enables the user to complete multiple actions before exiting the program.
